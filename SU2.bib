The roughness is added in the form of grooves. Straight and branching ducts are considered in order to better explore the mechanisms causing attenuation of the shock and the physics behind the evolution of the complex wave patterns resulting from diffraction and reflection of the primary moving shock. A well-established finite volume numerical method is used and further validated for several test cases relevant to this study. The computed results are compared with experimental measurements in ducts with grooves. Good agreement between high resolution simulations and the experiment is obtained for the shock speeds and complex wave patterns created by the grooves. High frequency response time histories of pressure at various locations were recorded in the experiments. The recorded pressure histories and shock strengths were found in fair agreement with the two-dimensional simulation results as long as the shock stays in the duct. Overall, the physics of the interactions of the moving shock, the diffracted and reflected waves with the grooves are adequately captured in the high resolution simulations. Therefore, shocks propagating in ducts with different groove geometries have been simulated in order to identify the groove shape that diminishes shock strength.},

The objective of this research is to simulate the propagation of shock waves in ducts with roughness. The roughness is added in the form of grooves as in an existing experiment. Different shapes are considered in order to better understand the physics behind the evolution of the complex shock patterns resulting from diffraction, reflection and refraction of the primary moving shock. The contribution of grooves and duct shape on these phenomena and pressure attenuation is investigated. The numerical method is validated through several test cases, and the results are compared against the theory and the experimental measurements. Good agreement between high resolution computations and the experiment is obtained for the shock speeds and complex wave patterns created by the grooves. Time histories of pressure at various locations are also compared. It is found that accurate pressure history agreement requires a close representation of the full experimental setup to fully capture boundary layer development, and pressure losses associated with unsteady moving shocks in long ducts. Different groove geometries have been tested in the numerical computation in order to identify the shape that will diminish shock strength, hence pressure extrema more effectively. Analysis and animations of the computed results are employed to reveal salient features of the unsteady flowfield.},
